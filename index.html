<h2>History</h2>

<b>Accordo</b>

<p>This role required that I guide a project team into a fast, regular, release cycle. The project was predominately growing in the front end so to achieve this I separated the AngularJS from the .NET MVC stack and integrated Webpack / Gulp / ES6 / Auth0 tools to reduce the dependencies in deploying and provide access to modern tooling. In this position I also focused on mentoring the existing team with the new tools and imbuing confidence and optimism into the day to day work flow.</p>

<p>After achieving this I moved onto another project to help with reskinning that application and provided feedback about the existing React / Redux architecture.</p>

<b>Bauer Media</b>

<p>This engagement was focused on transforming a small (7-10 people) print media team into a mid sized (25+ people) digital media team.</p>

<p>My role was as the Lead Front End Engineer and in order to achieve this on the technical front I solidified React as the front end technology which set the stage to build an environment of component reuse. This involved setting up the infrastructure for sharing and creating boilerplates for new libraries and projects. From a people and process perspective this involved changing the mindset from isolated monolithic development to a distributed micro-service perspective. While this presented many challenges it was very rewarding to observe the thought process move from 'how does this fit within my project' to 'how can this be used elsewhere too' on an application scale.</p>

<p>In this position I was responsible for four scrum teams which involved technical leadership, especially in the front end space, helping improve delivery speed, removing roadblocks and ensuring adherence to the scrum process. These four teams each had one or more projects they were involved with which ranged from greenfield projects that needed to be ready to scale up, legacy systems that required maintenance or improvements and the introduction of micro libraries / components that were used across projects.</p>

<p>In this role I reported directly to the CTO and was a part of the AUS/NZ Technical Leadership team. A big factor in the decision to move towards reusable components was an effort to reduce duplication across the Tasman in the development space.</p>

<p>I had between 3-6 line reports at different points throughout. With these reports I was responsible for career development and the day to day job satisfaction along with the general HR tasks.</p>
