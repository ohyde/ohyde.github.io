<h2>History</h2>

<b>Accordo</b>

<p>This role required that I guide a project team into a fast, regular, release cycle. This project was predominately growing in the front end so to achieve this I separated the AngularJS from the .NET MVC stack and integrated Webpack / Gulp / ES6 / Auth0 tools to reduce the dependencies in deployment and provide access to modern tooling. In this position I also focused on mentoring the existing team with the new tools and imbuing confidence and optimism into the day to day work flow.</p>

<p>After achieving this I moved onto another project to help with reskinning the application and provided feedback about the existing React / Redux architecture.</p>

<u>Technologies / Tools</u>
Front End - React, Redux, Angular, Angular2, RamdaJS, Mocha<br/>
Back End - .NET, NodeJS<br/>
Built Tools - Webpack, Gulp, Bitbucket Pipelines, Bamboo<br/>
Infrastructure - AWS S3 / Lambda, Azure Serverless, Auth0<br/>
Data - MySql<br/>

<h2>Bauer Media</h2>

<p>This engagement was focused on transforming a small (10+) print media team into a mid sized (30+) digital media team. My role was as the Lead Front End Engineer and in order to achieve this I solidified React as the front end technology going forward which set the stage to build an environment for component reuse. This involved setting up the infrastructure for sharing and creating boilerplates for new libraries and projects.</p>

<p>I was responsible for four scrum teams which involved technical leadership, especially in the front end space, helping improve delivery speed and adherence to the scrum process. These four teams each had one or more projects they were involved with which ranged from greenfield projects needing to scale, legacy systems requiring maintenance or improvements and the introduction of micro libraries / components.</p>

<p>In this role I reported directly to the CTO and was a part of the AUS/NZ Technical Leadership team. A big part in the decision to move towards reusable components was an effort to reduce duplication across the Tasman in the development space.</p>

<p>I had between 3-6 line management reports at different points throughout. With these reports I was responsible for career development and the day to day job satisfaction.</p>

<u>Technologies / Tools</u>
